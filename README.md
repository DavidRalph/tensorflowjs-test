# tensorflowjs-test

A simple TensorFlowJS experiment which identifies close matches in a list of input strings using Universal Sentence Encoder.

Matches are judged by mean pairwise similarity, so a group of matches may represent a theme or related concepts, or may represent only near equivelent items, depending on the variance in the responses.
